# Week 3: Cloud Services & Infrastructure as Code - Day 16 (March 28, 2023)

## Introduction

Today marks the culmination of our Week 3 project focusing on Cloud Services and Infrastructure as Code. After successfully implementing the infrastructure components over the past few days, today's goal was to deploy the complete infrastructure, push our containerized application to ECR, and validate the entire solution.

## Objectives

- Apply Terraform configuration to create all AWS resources
- Build and publish the Docker container image to ECR
- Deploy the application through ECS
- Validate application functionality through the load balancer
- Monitor application health and performance
- Document the complete solution architecture

## Accomplishments

### Infrastructure Deployment

Successfully applied the Terraform configuration to create all infrastructure resources.

### Container Image Build and Push

Built and pushed the Docker image to the ECR repository.

### Application Deployment and Validation

The ECS service automatically deployed the application using the latest image from ECR.

### Documentation and Architecture Diagram

Created comprehensive documentation including an architecture diagram showing all components and their relationships.

### Performance and Cost Analysis

Conducted initial performance analysis and cost estimation.

## Screenshot References

For documentation and reference purposes, I've captured screenshots of key configurations:

1. Terraform Apply Output
2. ECR Repository with Image
3. ECS Cluster with Tasks
4. Running Application
5. CloudWatch Logs
6. AWS Cost Explorer

## Conclusion

The Week 3 project has been successfully completed, with all objectives met and a fully functional cloud-based application deployment implemented using Infrastructure as Code principles. The modular approach to infrastructure design proved highly effective, allowing for clear separation of concerns while maintaining integration between components.

Key accomplishments include:
- Implementing a secure and scalable VPC architecture
- Creating a containerized application deployment pipeline
- Establishing proper monitoring and logging
- Applying infrastructure as code best practices
- Documenting the solution architecture and operational procedures
