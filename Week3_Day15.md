# Week 3: Cloud Services & Infrastructure as Code - Day 15 (March 14, 2023)

## Introduction

Following yesterday's implementation of networking and container registry components, today's focus was on setting up the compute infrastructure using Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service).

## Objectives

- Implement ECS cluster with Fargate launch type
- Configure task definitions and services for container deployment
- Set up Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- Implement auto-scaling for ECS services
- Configure CloudWatch logging and monitoring
- Integrate all infrastructure components

## Accomplishments

### ECS Cluster Implementation

Created the ECS cluster using Terraform.

### Task Definition Configuration

Defined the container task definition with appropriate CPU and memory allocations.

### Application Load Balancer

Set up ALB for traffic distribution to ECS services.

### ECS Service Configuration

Created the ECS service to run our containerized application.

### Auto-Scaling Configuration

Implemented auto-scaling to handle varying workloads.

### CloudWatch Logging

Configured CloudWatch logging for container monitoring.

### IAM Role Configuration

Set up appropriate IAM roles for ECS execution and tasks.

### Integration and Testing

Integrated all infrastructure components and validated with Terraform plan.

## Screenshot References

For documentation and reference purposes, I've captured screenshots of key configurations:

1. ECS Cluster Creation
2. Task Definition Configuration
3. ECS Service Setup
4. Load Balancer Configuration
5. Security Group Rules
6. CloudWatch Logs Setup

## Tomorrow's Plan (March 15)

1. Complete the infrastructure deployment with Terraform apply
2. Build and push the container image to ECR
3. Validate the deployed application functionality
4. Implement monitoring and alerting
5. Document the complete infrastructure architecture
6. Create operational runbook for the deployed application

## Conclusion

Day 15 marks significant progress in our cloud infrastructure implementation, with the successful configuration of ECS, load balancing, auto-scaling, and monitoring components.
