# Week 3: Cloud Services & Infrastructure as Code - Day 14 (March 13, 2023)

## Introduction

Having established the project foundation and Terraform setup on Day 13, today I focused on implementing the core networking infrastructure and container registry components. These elements form the critical foundation for a secure, scalable cloud deployment.

## Objectives

- Design and implement VPC architecture with public/private subnets
- Configure internet and NAT gateways for appropriate access
- Set up route tables and network ACLs for traffic control
- Create ECR repository with security and lifecycle policies
- Validate all infrastructure configurations before deployment

## Accomplishments

### VPC & Networking Implementation

Implemented comprehensive networking infrastructure with security and availability in mind.

### Security Group Configuration

Established security groups for controlled network access.

### ECR Repository Implementation

Created Elastic Container Registry (ECR) for Docker image storage.

### Module Outputs Configuration

Configured outputs for networking and ECR modules to facilitate integration.

### Terraform Plan Validation

Validated the infrastructure configuration with terraform plan.

## Screenshot References

For documentation and reference purposes, I've captured screenshots of key configurations:

1. VPC Configuration
2. Subnet Settings
3. Internet Gateway Creation
4. NAT Gateway Setup
5. Route Table Configurations
6. ECR Repository Creation

## Tomorrow's Plan (March 14)

1. Implement ECS cluster configuration with Fargate launch type
2. Create task definitions and service configurations for the container application
3. Set up Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
4. Configure auto-scaling policies for ECS services
5. Implement CloudWatch logging for containers
6. Test Terraform plan for the complete infrastructure

## Conclusion

Day 14 has been highly productive, with the successful implementation of the core networking infrastructure and container registry components.
